	  <h2> About CBD For The People </h2>
	  <p> CBD For The People is a California-based nonprofit dedicated to promoting and publicizing research into the medical uses of cannabidiol (CBD) and other components of the cannabis plant. We provide educational services for physicians, patients, industry professionals, and the general public.
	<br>
Project CBD was conceived in 2010 by two journalists who had been covering the medical marijuana story—the science, the movement and the industry—in the pages of O’Shaughnessy’s, the journal of cannabis in clinical practice. We felt that the reintroduction of CBD-rich cannabis into the grassroots supply merited special attention. The serendipitous reappearance of whole plant CBD in Northern California in 2009 has given doctors and patients a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of cannabidiol.</P>
